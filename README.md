# sol-launch
crowfunding app for solana 

the project is in develpment , to make it run git clone , then npm install 
when finished , the project is a crowfunding App 

imagine you have an idea but monney is missing , with my app you can ask from people who want to invest 
of course a project like thast already exist but with solana and the power of the blockchain the investior would have the power to vote everytime you need to buy something for the project so it secure them as you cannot leave with the monney 
for you it is also better as investeors will be more confident to invest 

at the time I only made a page but i wiull make more , 
1- presentation of the app 
2- to login 
3-once you are login you can see your campaign that you invested ( for investors ) , and for tyhe creator youc an see the monney you have and how many people they did ionvest 





important note : each investor can only votre once when creator needs to buy something 
each vote would be count as 1 as their is a minimum to invest anyway 


for the rewards we need to put in place a way to end of the year give divident topt he investors depending on the oourcentage they earn and the success of the project itself
